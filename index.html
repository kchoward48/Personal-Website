                    <p>Greetings! My name is Kevin Howard, and I am currently a student studying web programming and software engineering. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems Programming from Purdue University in 2014, but due to some personal issues, I don't feel as though I was able to really excel as much as I should've. Now, however, after some time rehabilitating, all I want to do is learn as much about computer programming as possible, and strive to be the best in my field. Please feel free to refer to the menu below to be redirected to a specific section of this page. Thank you so much again for visiting!</p>
