                    <p class="lead text-center">I am currently a student studying web programming and software engineering. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems Programming from Purdue University in 2014, but due to some personal issues, I don't feel as though I was able to really excel as much as I should've. Now, however, after some time rehabilitating, all I want to do is learn as much about computer programming as possible, and strive to be the best in my field.
